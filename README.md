## Section 4 â€“ Technical Overview

### 1. Comprehensive Overview
This code is used to create a visual art canvas containing circles and lines of various colors, presenting a dynamic layout. The code utilizes the p5.js library and employs the `setup()` and `drawElements()` functions to draw elements and adjust the scale according to the window size.

### 2. Code Snippets and Explanation

#### 2.1 Initialization Settings
**Explanation**: The `setup()` function initializes the size of the canvas, sets the background color, and calls `drawElements()` to draw the elements. The scale factor `scaleFactor` is used to dynamically adjust the size of the elements.

#### 2.2 Circle Class
**Explanation**: The `Circle` class defines the properties of a circle (position, radius, color) and the `draw()` method, which is used to draw circles on the canvas.

#### 2.3 Line Class
**Explanation**: The `Line` class defines the properties of a line (start and end positions, color, line thickness) and the `draw()` method, which is used to draw lines on the canvas.

#### 2.4 `function windowResized()`
**Function**: Dynamically adjusts the canvas size. When the browser window size changes, the canvas automatically resizes and redraws all elements.
